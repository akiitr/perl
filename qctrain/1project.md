Mini Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Quiz Application
This is one of the interesting  project ideas to create. This is a standard quiz application that presents a set of carefully curated questions to the users (a questionnaire), allows them to answer the same, and displays the correct answer if they are wrong. Each test will display the final score of the user. The application will have an account creation option, wherein some users can be appointed as Admins.

These Admins can create tests for other users. In this way, the tests and quizzes continue to be updated. This application requires a database to store all the questions, answers, and scores of the users. You can also include additional features like timers for tests.


2. Instagram Photo Downloader

This would be an app that automatically downloads all the Instagram images of your friends. It is quite similar to the above command line app as this app will use your credentials to open your account and then look for your friend’s ID and download their photos. This app would be handy when people want to delete pages and save just the images.


3. Expense Tracker
As you can guess by the name, an expense tracker is a software application that lets you keep track of your expenses, and even analyze the expenses. In this project, you will build a simple expense tracker that can keep track of the user’s expenses.

The application should also be able to perform statistical analysis to give accurate insights to users on their expenses so that they can plan their expenses better. 

4. File Explorer
This is a significant project as it will test your knowledge on the various concepts of Perl. You need to build an app that anyone uses to explore the files in their system. You can also add features like searching and copy-paste. Tk is a commendable choice for this project as it makes the development of GUI applications fast and easy.


5. Post-it Notes
Post-it notes are an excellent way to note down trivial chores so that you don’t forget to do them. In this project, we’ll make a virtual version of the physical, adhesive post-it notes. The main goal of building this application is to allow users to carry their post-it notes wherever they go (since it is on a digital platform).


6. Alarm Clock & Countdown Clock and Timer

People all across the globe use alarm clock applications. It is quite a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) application for an intermediate-level developer. However, this project isn’t your run-of-the-mill alarm clock. In this application, you can input YouTube links in a text file and design the application to read the file. If you set a particular time in the alarm clock, it will pick a random YouTube link from the text file and play the YouTube video.

It is another utility app in which the user can set a timer, and the app notifies you when time is up.
